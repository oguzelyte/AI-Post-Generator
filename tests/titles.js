The list post title
For whatever reason, people love lists of things. The 7 best vacuum cleaners. The 11 coolest used cars. 14 weird cat photos.

These list posts, or “listicles,” can help you get more clicks. A study by Moz found that using numbers in your headline can drive up to 15% more clicks.

export const titleSystemPrompt2 = `The “how to” title
The classic how-to guide has been around forever. It just does what it promises: teaches you how to do something you want to know how to do.

It helps to include proof of some kind, similar to the data-backed title formula you’re going to learn about in a moment.

Examples:

How to Execute the Skyscraper Technique (And Get Results)
How to Keep Mice Out of Your Camper (The Easy Way)
How to Learn a New Language: 7 Secrets From TED Translators`;
export const titleSystemPrompt3 = `The what, why, or how title
You’ve seen this title formula if you’ve ever Googled what something is, why something is, or how something is. It’s a direct repeat of the question at hand.

This title is best when you know precisely what question your reader is asking. Just make your title the question itself, then (if you have enough room) give it some flair to entice the reader, as I did in the examples below.

Examples:

What Is an Atom Made Of? (The Answer Might Surprise You)
Why Does My Dog Drag Its Butt on the Ground?
How Long Is the Golden Gate Bridge?
What Is a Smart Home? [Infographic]
How Are Sociopaths Made? (Hint: They’re Not)`;
export const titleSystemPrompt4 = `The “versus” title
When someone is trying to decide between two or three options, a comparison article putting them head-to-head is exactly what they need.

Examples:

Ahrefs vs. SEMrush vs. Moz: What the Industry Thinks
Paddleboard vs. Kayak: Is One Better Than the Other?
Choosing Your RV: Class A vs. Class C Motorhomes
Judo vs. Jiu Jitsu: What’s the Difference?
PS5 vs. Xbox Series X: Which Console Wins?`;
export const titleSystemPrompt5 = `The ultimate guide title
When you’re looking to deep-dive into studying a new hobby or interest, you want to know everything you need to succeed, right?

Enter: The ultimate guide.

When you build something amazing that teaches the reader everything about a subject, this title formula is a sure-fire way to get more clicks.

Examples:

SaaS SEO: The Ultimate Tried & Tested Guide
The Ultimate Guide to Living in a Van in 2022
The Ultimate Guide to Weight Loss: Drop Pounds Easily`;
export const titleSystemPrompt6 = `The devil’s advocate title
Going against a commonly-held belief can sometimes pique a curious reader’s interest and get them to click on your title. The more you can turn a popular view on its head, the more effective this title template.

Examples:

Why ‘Following Your Passion’ Is Horrible Advice (What to Do Instead)
Why Running Is Actually Horrible for You (Do This Instead)
This High-Fat Diet Is Actually Healthy & Great for Weight Loss
How Adding Keywords to Your Blog Posts Is Hurting Your SEO
Coffee Is Good for You… or Is It? A Look at the Newest Science`;
export const titleSystemPrompt7 = `The direct answer title
Like the what, why, how-to titles, a direct answer title gives searchers back what they searched for. But instead of repeating the question, you’re providing the answer right in your title.

This template is great for any questions with an immediate and straightforward answer, but there’s more to learn than what meets the eye.

Examples:

TikTok Has Over 5 Billion Users. Here’s What That Means
Barack Obama Is Now 60 Years Old - But Did You Know…?
Jesus Was Born Between 6 and 4 BC: Here’s What We Know
It Takes 2-6 Months to Rank on Google (But There’s More to the Story)
The Golden Gate Bridge Is 1.7 Miles Long - But How Was It Made?`;
